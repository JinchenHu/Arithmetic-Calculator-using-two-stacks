# Arithmetic Calculator using two stacks
In this programming assignment, you will expand and implement the pseudo code discussed in class for an arithmetic calculator that uses two different stacks. The expansion will involve: inclusion of more binary operators and inclusion of the parentheses pairs (possibly nested ones). You will implement your code in Java. Your arithmetic calculator must read lines of text from a text file, where each line contains a syntactically correct arithmetic expression. Your output file must repeat the input line and print the computed result on the next line. Your calculators must support the following operators on integers and follow the standard operator precedence as shown in the following (1 to 6: 1 is the highest and 6 is the lowest. Same precedence operators are evaluated from left to right).

  1. Parentheses (possibly nested ones): ( , )
  2. power function: x^y.
  3. operators: *, /
  4. operators: +, -
  5. operators: >, ≥, ≤, <
  6. operators: ==, !=
  
  Implement a Java program. In your program, you will implement and use your own array-based stack (and not the built-in Java stack) of dynamic size based on the linearly incremental strategy to be discussed in class.
